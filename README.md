## Frontend lecture course

Hey!

I'm web-developer and tutor.

This site is used to teach the frontend course (in Ukrainian).

At the moment there are about 80 lectures for 2 hours each.

The course continues to be further developed:
- new materials (task runners, sockets, 3D-graphics, etc.) will be added;
- materials will be broken down by topic, not by lectures (there will be about 300 topics);
- there will be self-tests and test tasks;
- homeworks was being modified and added;
- the course will be divided into 3 parts: layout, programming, web graphics.
